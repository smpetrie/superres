Supplementary material for the paper *Quantifying trade-offs in satellite hardware configurations via a super-resolution framework with realistic image degradation*.

The `_config.yml` file contains things like the webpage style, title, and subtitle. The `index.md` file contains the main body text in the main page. `get_image_names.py` writes a text file containing the names of all images used in this "superres" github.io page.
