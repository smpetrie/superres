This page contains Supplementary material for the manuscript: *Quantifying trade-offs in satellite hardware configurations via a realistic satellite image degradation and super-resolution framework*.

For each terrain type, the following pages show zoomed images that highlight the variability of super-resolution image reconstruction quality under several different degradation values:

[Beach](beach.md)

[Forest](forest.md)

[Rural](rural.md)

[Rural with Urban](rural_w_urban.md)

[Urban](urban.md)
